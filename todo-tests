experiments/vector tiles - not working
experiments/custom-projections/Arctic-SDI/ Canada  link not working

deal with flaky tests???

core/featureIndexOverlay test is broken, integrate other PR

get rid of 'foo' event
split up and move createAndAdd functionality from onAdd to initialize + onAdd

dynamically update layer bounds as features added/removed from it

migrate some stuff from map-feature to FeatureLayer e.g. removeInFeatureList move it
evaluate what belongs to what

refactor FeatureLayer into subclasses for static features, query features, templated features, templated tile features

add zoomend / layeradd event handler for FeatureLayer that checks what features should be rendered
