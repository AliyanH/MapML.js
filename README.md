# web-map Customized Built-In &lt;map&gt; Element

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/prushforth/Web-Map-Custom-Element.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/prushforth/Web-Map-Custom-Element)

The web-map Customized Built-In &lt;map&gt; Element is a [prototype implementation](http://maps4html.github.io/Web-Map-Custom-Element/) of the [HTML-Map-Element specification](http://maps4html.github.io/HTML-Map-Element/spec/).

## Objective

The objective of this web component is to upgrade the &lt;map&gt; HTML element to support modern Web mapping requirements.  As such, it relies on [Map Markup Language](http://maps4html.github.io/mapml/spec/) which delivers map information as hypertext.
This element depends on the [MapML Leaflet Plugin javascript library](https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Leaflet-Plugin).
